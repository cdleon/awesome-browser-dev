- **Browser Support**

  * [State of WebType](http://stateofwebtype.com/) :gift_heart: - Up-to-date data on support for type and typographic features on the web.

- **Font Style Matchers**

  * [Font style matcher](https://meowni.ca/font-style-matcher/) :gift_heart: - If you're using a web font, you're bound to see a flash of unstyled text (or FOUC), between the initial render of your websafe font and the webfont that you've chosen. This usually results in a jarring shift in layout, due to sizing discrepancies between the two fonts. To minimize this discrepancy, you can try to match the fallback font and the intended webfontâ€™s x-heights and widths. This tool helps you do exactly that. 
 * [Typetura](https://typetura.com/) :money_bag: - We typeset your website.
