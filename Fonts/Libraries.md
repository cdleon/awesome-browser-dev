- [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/) :gift_heart: - Free fonts have met their match. We know how hard it is to find quality freeware that is licensed for commercial work. We've done the hard work, hand-selecting these typefaces and presenting them in an easy-to-use format. [https://www.fontsquirrel.com/](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) :gift_heart: - Our goal is to create a directory of web fonts for the world to use. Our API service makes it easy to add Google Fonts to a website in seconds. The service runs on Google's servers which are fast, reliable and tested. Google provides this service free of charge.
